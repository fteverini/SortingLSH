For a given number of digits, sort binary digits in a way we contiguous digits differ from only one digit. Equivalent to travelling through the unit hypercube of dimension d through edges passing one unique time into each vertex. For example, if d = 4,  we can sort all the binary digits as following : 0000,0001,0011,0010,0110,0111,0101,0100,1100,1101,1111,1110,1010,1011,1001,1000
